			<p>The following is the thread for the DC FOIA request that lead to getting the data.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="msg">
			<p>	From: Joshua Tauberer<br>
				To: DCHBX<br>
				Subject: FOIA Request<br>
				Date: October 9, 2013 12:08pm</p>

			<p>To whom it may concern,</p>

			<p>This is a request under the DC Freedom of Information Act.</p>

			<p>I am requesting:</p>

			<p>The electronic database of health insurance plans offered on DC's health insurance marketplace (DCHealthLink).</p>

			<p>To clarify, I am seeking the list of insurance plans being made available to individuals and business and the metadata associated with the plans, such as cost, the URL to SBC PDFs, the other information displayed on DCHealthLink's plan details page, and other metadata used on DCHealthLink to compare plans to preferences entered by the user (that is, not user data but the general information about each plan that user data is compared to). These records are likely stored in an electronic database. An SQL (most preferable) or CSV (less preferable) file containing this information would be an appropriate format in which to provide the data.</p>

			<p>I am requesting the records with the intent to provide the general public with information about the plans available to them in order to help the public make informed choices in the marketplace. Thus my request is in the public interest, and I request a fee waiver. I also request a fee estimate in advance.</p>

			<p>For your reference, I am the president of Civic Impulse, LLC, a DC-based company that promotes government transparency and accountability and citizen enagement using technology. I can be reached by email or at &mdash;.</p>

			<p>Thank you,</p>
